            <p>3.4 Products are subject to availability. If We are unable to supply You with the Products due to the fact that they are out of stock, We will inform You as soon as possible. You will be given the option of (i) waiting until the Products are in stock when We will perform the Contract; or (ii) cancelling Your affected order and obtaining a full refund (if We have already received payment from You).</p>

            <p>3.6 Please note that any details and/or specifications for the Products and/or Services produced by Us (including any photographs of the Products) are intended as a guide only to give a general approximation.</p>
            <p>3.7 We keep copies of all orders We receive and accept for a period of 5 years from the date of the order. This enables Us to process orders effectively, maintain high levels of customer service and deal with quality issues should they arise.</p>

            <h4>4. Cancellation</h4>
            <p>4.1 Once an order has been submitted your credit card will be charged. Our ordering process is streamlined so your order will immediately be sent to processing and then shipping. Due to the high volume of orders we receive we will be unable to cancel an order after submitted. Please order carefully.</p>
            <h4>5. Delivery</h4>
            <p>5.1 An estimated number of days for delivery will be provided after your order is placed. These dates vary due to carrier shipping practices, delivery location and the items you order. Products may be delivered in separate shipments. Any customs and taxes which may be charged by the relevant authorities in your country will be at your sole cost.</p>
            <p>5.2 Dates for delivery are estimates only and are not guaranteed. We do not guarantee arrival dates or times. Time is not of the essence in relation to such dates. They are also subject to any matter beyond Our reasonable control including without limitation those events set out in paragraph 15.2. The delivery will be performed by the courier service company, which will be selected at Our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>5.3 As a general rule, We will dispatch the Products to You on the same day as We accept Your order (subject to the Products being in stock) or the next working day if Your order is placed outside of our normal working hours. We charge for delivery and packaging. These delivery prices are detailed on the Website and are subject to change, depending on Your address, time of year, religious and/or national holidays, etc.</p>
            <p>5.4 In most cases, orders will be delivered to You by special delivery, requiring a signature to confirm receipt. It is Your responsibility to ensure that there is someone at the delivery address to sign for the Products when delivered. Alternatively, it is Your responsibility to collect the Products from any postal collection depot and/or arrange an alternative delivery date if You are unavailable to sign for the Products.</p>
            <p>5.5 We are not responsible for the Products and their safe delivery after they have left Our possession. If You have any issues regarding non-delivery, late delivery and/or damage to the Products during transit, You must take this up with the carrier. We will provide You with their details on your request.</p>
            <p>This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other supplements. If you plan to use a supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.</p>
            <h4>6. Prices and payment</h4>
            <p>6.1 The price for Products and Services shall be as shown on the Website at the date of Our acceptance of Your order. All fees are payable in Euro currency.
